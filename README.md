Royal Dine™ System is specially designed for the mess/hostel students who need to maintain their regular meal schedule, cost estimation etc. We know students have to face a lot of hassle in terms of hostel/mess life meal management. It becomes quiet tougher to maintain every day’s meal, bazar schedules, meals for new guests & so on. So, this system will help them to keep track their weekly/monthly/yearly meal cost estimation to be automated over online.
